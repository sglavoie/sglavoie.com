# What is this repository?

This repository is all the content that is available at **[sglavoie.com](https://www.sglavoie.com/)** and hosted on **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**. It will aim to provide useful information while documenting my journey as a learner in technology-related matters.

It will become a tech journal with the specific goal of explaining the challenges that I will inevitably face while trying to become a better student and most importantly, it will be a reference to the solutions that I found along the way so that it can benefit others too.

# Why yet another blog?

If I'm being honest, the answer is fourfold:

1. I am being somewhat narcissistic in the process of writing an open blog like this, writing about my own experience the whole time. However my goal is really to make my learning stick around longer and as a byproduct, I wish to share with the world interesting ideas and provide some kind of support as a way to give back to the community. I could not write about something that I do not know, so writing about my journey seems quite fitting. Also, I would hope that with so many people in the world, someone out there is going to find an answer that satisfies his/her curiosity and I would be happy to contribute to advancing someone else's plan.

2. I am a French Canadian speaker from Quebec and never really practiced my English in order to reach an acceptable level of fluency, which is a shame since it is one of the only two official languages in Canada! This website, apart from being a reason to be accountable for my learning, will hopefully improve my communication skills at the same time.

3. I always enjoyed the written word and to this day, it remains my favorite way of communicating meaningful things with others. I find that having the ability to iterate over any word or sentence makes for great punch lines and generates more impact in many situations. I would say this is one of the reasons why I loved programming in the first place: nothing remains the same forever because the freedom to apply changes never goes away. You always have the chance to fix a line of broken code, to modify a function or class, to add comments and documentation, etc. I find it really comforting to think about the endless possibilities that open up with this kind of activity. Spontaneity is of course a wonderful aspect of being human, but the mastery that can be achieved through perfecting an existing project remains very satisfying because we never get it right the first time and there is always room for improvement! Reading has become an intrinsic part of me: it helps me reach my goals; it has been a precious ally when dealing with bouts of depression; it has been a fantastic way of keeping in touch with lost friends and family members and getting to know people that I never had the luxury of meeting in person. Highly recommended ;).

4. I needed to find a way to get better at using `Vim`/`Neovim` as my main text editor and I figured out that editing a lot of text could be a way to go.


# How was it done?

It is all generated with the help of **[Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican)**, a static website generator that uses **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**. The content of the website is written in Markdown format and is rendered automatically as HTML and CSS with some bits of JavaScript here and there.

Here are the main reasons why this approach felt right:
- It is very easy to maintain. Once the design is done, you simply write in Markdown and you are good to go. It is also easy to modify a theme or have a collection of themes stored in a directory with a bunch of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and image files.
- It is super quick to deploy anywhere without having any kind of specific server requirements such as PHP, Python, SSL, MySQL, Apache, etc. Everything is static and can be uploaded almost everywhere!
- It's also quite secure in the end as there is no need to perform updates, no need to authenticate users or deal with a database.
